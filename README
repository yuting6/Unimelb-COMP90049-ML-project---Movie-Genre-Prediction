Description

This project contains three machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and MLP. And these classifiers will be implemented to a movie classification test using an open ended dataset.



Architecture

In this project, there are three major files including Nb-classifier.ipynb, Decision tree classifier.ipynb, and MLP classifier.ipynb. And each classifier implements two kinds of data processing methods such as One-Hot and Tf-Idf. In Decision tree classifier, it executes two different parameters, "Gini" and "Entropy", these parameters will influence the classifier's performance.

    Nb-classifier.ipynb:
        The chosen Naïve Bayes classifier is Gaussian NB.
